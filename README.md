### ðŸ§© **Repository Overview**

This repository contains individual computer-vision projects completed for **ECE 5367 (Computer Vision)** at Texas Tech University.
Each project focuses on classical vision techniques, emphasizing image analysis, geometric understanding, and algorithmic implementation without deep-learning frameworks.
All projects are implemented and documented independently.

### **Project 1 â€“ Day / Night Image Classification**

Developed a simple statistical vision method to distinguish **daytime** and **nighttime** scenes using image brightness and color characteristics.

---

### **Project 2 â€“ Card Alignment and Cropping**

Designed an end-to-end algorithm that automatically detects rotation of a rectangular card, corrects its orientation, and produces an upright, tightly cropped output.
