🧩 Repository Overview  
This repository contains individual computer-vision projects completed for ECE 5367 (Image Processing).  
Each project focuses on classical image-processing techniques, with Project 5 extending into modern deep-learning denoising.

---

## Project 1 – Day / Night Image Classification
Developed a simple statistical method to distinguish daytime and nighttime scenes using image brightness and color characteristics.

---

## Project 2 – Card Alignment and Cropping
Designed an end-to-end algorithm that automatically detects rotation of a rectangular card, corrects its orientation, and produces an upright, tightly cropped output.

---

## Project 3 – Frequency-Domain Illumination Correction
Implemented a Fourier-based image decomposition method to separate periodic surface patterns and illumination.  
Used multi-lobe Butterworth band-pass filters to extract high-frequency texture and low-pass filters to estimate smooth illumination.

---

## Project 4 – Playing Card Detection and Classification
Implemented a classical vision pipeline for detecting and classifying playing cards using contour extraction, geometric alignment, and template matching.

---

## Project 5 – Image Denoising (Classical vs Deep Learning)
Compared classical denoising methods (Smoothing, Median, Adaptive/Lee filter) with modern deep-learning models (DnCNN and Restormer).  
Synthetic Gaussian and salt-and-pepper noise were added, and results were evaluated using PSNR and SSIM metrics.
